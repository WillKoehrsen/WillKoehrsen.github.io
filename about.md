## Current



* Lead data scientist at [Cortex Building Intelligence](https://cortexintel.com) in New York City
* Building tools to help commercial office buildings operate more energy efficiently

## Previous

 Previously, I was a data scientist at Feature Labs, working on automated feature engineering and solving data science problems for customers. In college at Case Western Reserve University,
I was a member of the [EDIFES research team](https://arpa-e.energy.gov/?q=slick-sheet-project/virtual-building-energy-audits) developing a data science platform for virtual energy audits. I'm an avid data science advocate and communicator on [Towards Data Science](http://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen/) where I write about an article per week on data science topics. All my articles are free because I believe in allowing everyone equal access to information.

## Live Code

Most about pages are pretty dull. To mix things up, I've included a live Python editor where you can edit and run code. Thanks to [repl.it](https://repl.it/) for making this possible.
