## 30 ideas that changed my worldview

_“The unexamined life is not worth living”_ is one of those  of what is best described as “pseudo-profound dribble” (dribble being a [family-friendly replacement](http://journal.sjdm.org/15/15923a/jdm15923a.pdf) for the correct term).

In reality, a life lived without looking back is totally worth living; in fact, those who live in the present are generally y/dp/1626254060). As [I’ve written](/@williamkoehrsen/regretting-the-present-3f83c21ff1f0), thinking too much about the past can lead to regret as we second-guess our decisions that didn’t go well. There are even entire philosophies — [Stoicism](https://modernstoicism.com/features-the-philosophy-of-stoic-mindfulness-by-patrick-ussher/) — about living in the present and letting go of the past. Those Socrates-quoting (it was [probably Socrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_unexamined_life_is_not_worth_living) who uttered this quote, at least according to Plato) people don’t even think about what they are saying, let alone realize how _absurd_ the statement is.

So, now I’ve told you about the uselessness of reflection, it’s time to reflect on what I learned in 2018! I was originally going to use that Socrates quote to start this article and lecture you about the importance of looking backwards, before, in a plot twist, realizing it’s complete bunk. Fortunately, this about-face reinforces the one overarching idea I took away from 2018: _we are all wrong about a lot of things a lot of the time, but, we can get less wrong_.

While some may view this conclusion pessimistically — if we’re just going to be wrong, why learn anything at all? — I see it as a great opportunity. Yes, we are _currently_ wrong about many of our beliefs — [including our foundational ideas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Righteous_Mind) — but that just means we have the chance to _get less wrong as we go through life_. As we accumulate experiences and learn from data, we can gain a more accurate worldview and, as we’ll see, it turns out _that worldview is almost always more optimistic than we originally thought._

To continue in my quest to get less wrong and because the end of the year is a time for lists, I’ve listed 30 things I learned in 2018 from books, podcasts, life, and other people. These aren’t meant to be absolute truths, and, I wouldn’t be surprised if a year from now I come back and correct the majority of these! I don’t claim these are the final beliefs I’ll hold the rest of my life, just what I currently believe. As the evidence and society changes, I’ll re-evaluate my positions to make sure they are still compatible with reality.

## One Year, 30 Ideas

I’ve listed the sources for these ideas in parenthesis and provided a link the first time a source appears. _Books are in italics,_ “podcasts or short works are in quotes”, and **life** is something I picked up through everyday experiences or from family, friends, co-workers, etc. As a glimpse into my ever-evolving worldview, this is more personal than what I usually write but as always, if you have criticisms, objections, or your own ideas, don’t hesitate to add a comment or write to me on Twitter!

With that said, here’s what I learned in 2018:

1.  The world _has never been better_ and _continues to improve_ despite a general consensus of the opposite. Far from being a naively optimistic idea, this is a conclusion _fully supported by the relevant data and statistics_: Humans today are _less violent, healthier, wealthier, have more rights, and do a better job of protecting the environment_ than at any point in recorded history. ([_Factfulness_](https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250107817)_;_ [_Enlightenment Now_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_Now)_;_ [_The Rational Optimist_](http://www.rationaloptimist.com/)_)_
2.  Fulfillment does not from external rewards or material accumulation but is derived internally, by doing work that you can take pride in. We create meaning in life through our work — which does not have to be a traditional job. ([_Drive_](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/05/09/daniel-pink-drive-rsa-motivation/)_;_ [_The Road to Character_](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/david-brookss-search-for-meaning)_,_ [_Mastery_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastery_(book))_;_ **life**)
3.  Meditation is difficult, requires a formidable amount of concentration, and only improves slowly with deliberate repetition, yet the scientifically (and experimentally) proven benefits make it a worthwhile practice ([_Waking Up_](https://samharris.org/books/waking-up/)_;_ [_10% Happier_](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062265425/10-happier/)_;_ [“The Waking Up Podcast”](https://samharris.org/podcast/); **life**)
4.  We have built a society with _almost unlimited options_ from the smallest choices — which toothpaste to buy — to the largest — what to study — yet, rather than creating a utopia, this has made us _miserable_ and _contributed to increased rates of depression_. More options mean we _spend longer making decisions_ and _more time regretting them_ ([_The Paradox of Choice_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice); **life**)
5.  An incredibly valuable — yet exceedingly rare — skill is the ability to change one’s mind in light of new evidence. Changing one’s positions when the facts change is _not a sign of weakness but shows mental fortitude._ The entire enterprise of science is based on self-criticism and updating theories as better evidence is found. _(_[_Hitch-22_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitch-22)_;_ [_Superforecasting_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting)_;_ [_Science Friction_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Friction_(book))_)_
6.  Data are _never objective_. The very act of collecting information encodes biases in it that reflect the _goals of those gathering the information_ and the measurement tools ([_Dataclysm_](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/25/2710913); [_The Signal and the Noise_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Signal_and_the_Noise))
7.  Morals/ethics are a _product of evolution_ and were _not invented by any particular religion_. As a natural phenomenon, we can scientifically study morals/ethics to make _objective claims_ about the right actions to take. ([_The Moral Landscape_](https://samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape/)_;_ [_The Science of Good and Evil_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Good_and_Evil)_; Behave_)
8.  To make accurate predictions: constantly make forecasts and use the feedback to improve your next estimates, gather data from as many diverse sources of information as possible, express predictions with uncertainty, and change your predictions when the facts on the ground change (_The Signal and the Noise; Superforecasting_)
9.  The fact that living standards are getting better around the world means that our policies in areas such as poverty reduction, disease eradication, environmental protection, and human rights expansion are working. Viewing the world as it really is — rather than through a distorted lens — not only gives us a more optimistic, realistic worldview, it also shows we collectively have the ability to improve the world and should keep at this endeavor (_Enlightenment Now; Factfulness_)
10.  Writing is thinking: there is no better way to make sure you understand a topic than writing an article about it for a general audience. If you are struggling to understand a concept, try writing an article — even if it’s just to yourself. ([_Bird by Bird_](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/11/22/bird-by-bird-anne-lamott/); **life**)
11.  Problems are solvable. Whenever you encounter a problem, know there is an answer as long as you’re willing to work at it. Anything not prohibited by the laws of physics can be accomplished by humans given enough time. ([_The Beginning of Infinity_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity))
12.  There is no single secret to doing hard things like writing, learning a new skill, or making a positive life adjustment. There is instead a sequence of simple, actionable steps that over time add up to a major change (_Bird by Bird; Behave_; [_Deep Learning Cookbook_](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920097471.do)_;_ **life**)
13.  “Natural” does not mean good. Rape, xenophobia, vengeance, outrage, and violence are all natural, but very few people (apart from the president of the United States) would argue we need more of them. Don’t fall for the myth that natural is better than man-made whether it is used as an argument for a food, product, or opinion ([_The Blank Slate_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate)_; Behave_)
14.  No matter your external situation, you can be miserable or in euphoria depending on your mental state and attitude. Happiness is not about what happens to us but about how we respond to it. (_Waking Up;_ [_How to be Miserable_](http://www.randypaterson.com/Books/page18/page18.html)_;_ [_“_Stoicism philosophy”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism); **life**)
15.  Free will — the idea we make choices at our own discretion — **does not exist**. (_Behave; The Science of Good and Evil;_ [_Incognito_](https://www.eagleman.com/incognito)_; The Blank Slate;_ [_Predictably Irrational_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictably_Irrational)_;_ “The Waking Up Podcast”)
16.  If you are by yourself, you should be working; if you aren’t working, spend your time with others. (s.com/quotes/130011-if-you-are-idle-be-not-solitary-if-you-are), _How to be Miserable_)
17.  Helping others — through volunteering, writing, teaching, a public service job, or being there to listen — is the most rewarding experience a human being can have. (_The Road to Character; Behave_; **life**)
18.  The advertising model for the Internet is a terrible idea: instead of paying directly for content, we pay with our limited time and attention. A subscription model is more sustainable, more honest for all parties, and can lead to better content that is not constrained by advertiser’s agendas (“The Waking Up Podcast”; **life**)
19.  Capitalism may be the _single best anti-poverty device ever invented_. It is also effective at increasing health, raising living standards, expanding human rights, protecting the environment and increasing tolerance. While capitalism _is not perfect_, it’s the _best way to organize an economy_ thus far put in place (_The Rational Optimist; Enlightenment Now_)
20.  There (probably) is not a single universe, but an infinite number of them — a multiverse. We (possibly) are living in a simulation and soon will reach the point where we can create our own simulated worlds. Neither of these should affect how you live your life. ([_Our Mathematical Universe_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Mathematical_Universe)_;_ [_The Inevitable_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inevitable_(book))_; But What if We’re Wrong;_ “The Waking Up Podcast”)
21.  History only appears to follow a straight path in hindsight (the narrative fallacy). History books typically draw a single path to connect events _after the fact,_ when reality is actually a mess of _random occurrences_ that follow no plan. ([_The Black Swan_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan:_The_Impact_of_the_Highly_Improbable); [_But What If We’re Wrong_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/But_What_If_We%27re_Wrong%3F); _Predictably Irrational_)
22.  A certain amount of stress is beneficial for people and systems. We should aim not just to be _resilient against stress_, but to learn how to _gain from it._ Moreover, sometimes we are better off eliminating things from our lives (tv, news) rather than adding new things — a concept known as addition by subtraction. ([_Antifragile_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile)_;__The Black Swan; Behave_; **life**)
23.  Writing consistently improves your writing (and thinking) and makes it easier. Even bad writing is better than no writing; get your ideas down in a rough first draft without worrying about how good it is. (_Bird by Bird_; **life**)
24.  One of the most effective ways to be miserable is to reduce your exercise. Other good ways include spending as much time as possible with screens, focusing only on yourself, and revisiting past decisions (_How to be Miserable_; CGPGrey video [“7 Ways to Maximize Misery”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO1mTELoj6o&source=post_page---------------------------))
25.  The 21st century may be defined by an increasing gap between those with technical skills who can control computers (programmers) and those who whose jobs will be taken by (narrowly) intelligent machines. This is problematic because a world without meaningful work for humans would be a complete dystopia. ([_21 Lessons for the 21st Century_](https://www.ynharari.com/book/21-lessons/)_)_
26.  Innovation occurs most often _not deep within one field_, but at _intersections between fields_. It is in these fertile boundary grounds that ideas find applications beyond the original narrow use envisaged by the inventor. Make sure to not silo yourself within your field. ([_The Innovators_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovators_(book)))
27.  Humans are not born with _equal abilities or opportunities_, and ignoring this leads to policies that reinforce disadvantages rather than working to eliminate them. The theory that people are born the same (“blank slate”) denies all biological evidence to the contrary (_The Blank Slate; Behave_).
28.  Formal education is, unfortunately, necessary for most jobs, not because you will learn anything useful, but because you need a piece of paper certifying you can jump through arbitrary hoops and follow orders. Also, college can be detrimental to _physical, mental, and financial health_. (**life**)
29.  Minimalism is an enjoyable lifestyle: modern consumer culture has taught us fulfillment comes in the form of new cars, gadgets, and items, but it really comes from the work we do and the experiences we have. Limiting the number of things you own makes it easier to travel, reduces costs, and frees you to focus on the important things in life (_The Paradox of Choice_; _Drive_; _The Inevitable;_ “The Waking Up Podcast”; **life**)
30.  In New York City, it’s possible to live my dream life _without either a car_ — thanks to public transit — _or a permanent address_ — thanks to Airbnb. (**life**)
