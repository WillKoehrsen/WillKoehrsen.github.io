## How to quickly export Medium articles to your blog

If like me, you got your start blogging on Medium, but also want to build your own website to display your articles, you’ll need a way to move articles from Medium to the Markdown language. [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a lightweight language meant to be converted into HTML for the web, and there are several tools that allow you to go from existing Medium articles to Markdown for a blog.

(If you don’t yet have a blog, then follow [this guide](https://medium.com/p/fd0b43cbd886?source=your_stories_page---------------------------) to build your own website in five minutes using Jekyll and GitHub pages.)

#### Medium to Markdown Tools

There is both a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/convert-medium-posts-to-m/aelnflnmpbjgipamcogpdoppjbebnjea) and a [command line tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medium-to-markdown) for taking your Medium posts to Markdown. Unfortunately, I’ve found the Chrome Extension to be unreliable, and if it does work, it makes a number of formatting errors that require correcting.

If you can get the chrome extension to work and you aren’t comfortable at the command line, then that is probably the best choice for you. However, I’ve found the command line tool to be better for my use because it works every time, and requires fewer re-adjustments to the text after running.

#### Using Medium-to-Markdown on the Command Line

The [medium-to-markdown command line](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medium-to-markdown) package is written in Javascript which means you’ll need `node` to run and `npm` to install the package. If you’re on Windows, use [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install both (it takes about 3 minutes). Then, install the package using `npm install medium-to-markdown`. The actual script you’ll need to run is available [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/medium-to-markdown), and also shown below.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/WillKoehrsen/f685c3aa4b0d4d9220d59404803bffa4.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<center>Medium to Markdown JS script</center>

To run, save the script as `medium-to-markdown.js`, change the `"<medium post url">` to the address of your published post, and type `node medium-to-markdown.js` at the command line (making sure the script is in your directory.

This will output the entire post as Markdown in your console. To redirect the output to a file, you can type `node medium-to-markdown.js >> file.md` If you’re using GitHub Pages + Jekyll for your blog, you’ll want to save the `md` file in the `_posts/` directory of your repository as `date-title.md` . For example, my [latest post file](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/willkoehrsen.github.io/tree/master/_posts) is `_posts/2018-09-16-Five-Minutes-to-Your-Own-Website.md` . Once the article has been converted to a properly named Markdown file, it can be published by pushing the repository to GitHub.

Personally, I found that process of manually renaming the file tedious, so I wrote a Python script that accepts a url of a published Medium post along a date, calls the `medium-to-markdown.js` conversion script with the url, and saves the resulting markdown with the correct file name. The script can be found [here](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/willkoehrsen.github.io/blob/master/_posts/medium_to_markdown.py), and the command line usage is below:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/WillKoehrsen/581a09667813eefafbc66d349130f992.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Overall, it takes 15 seconds to run the script and about 5 minutes for the website to update! Go to your blog to see the article rendered.

### Solutions to Common Issues

Both the Chrome Extension and Command line tool create minor issues in the Markdown that you’ll have to fix. I do all my editing in the [Prose online editor](http://prose.io) and like to pull up the editor and the original Medium article side-by-side.(I also frequently use the Chrome development tools — right click and `inspect` — on my blog to adjust the css and see the changes immediately. )

Following are a few of the issues I’ve noticed and how to fix them. I’ll assume you’re working with GitHub Pages and Jekyll for your blog (follow [this guide to get started](https://medium.com/p/fd0b43cbd886?source=user_profile---------2------------------)) although these tips may work with other frameworks. These solutions are not exhaustive, so if you run into any more problems, let me know in the comments or on Twitter.

#### Image Captions

As you can see above, the default conversion to Markdown renders image captions left-justified below the image. To center the captions, add the following to your `styles.scss` file (in the repository root directory):

```{css}
// Captions for images
img + em {
    font-style: italic;
    font-weight: 600;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    margin-top: 8px;
    display: block;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 14px;
    color: black;
}
```

Then, in the Markdown itself, change the caption text from the default shown on top to the bottom. Make sure the caption is on a _separate_ line:

*Original conversion of image*

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*biazqiCBQ75FzIhwJUjLFQ.png)
*Corrected conversion of image caption*

The caption will now be centered below the image.

*Caption centered below image.*

If you don’t like this styling, change the css listed above.

#### Side by Side Images

To render images [side by side in markdown](https://stackoverflow.com/a/24320279/5755357), you can use a two-column table.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*a5ziAz8BcoFDNgEj0k7D1w.png)
*Two-column table for side-by-side images*

I’ve found that you have to include the headers or the table does not show correctly. There are a [couple other options](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24319505/how-can-one-display-images-side-by-side-in-a-github-readme-md), but the table works well.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*rvgO-ghHjwaRV4ITr9J9Rg.png)
*Side by Side Images using a table*

Here’s the blank code for a table so just replace the `image_link` and `header`:

```{markdown}
Header Left |  Header Right
:--------:|:-------:
![](image_link)  |  ![](image_link)
```

* * *

#### Code Blocks

If you write a lot about programming, then you want your code to look great! Fortunately, unlike on Medium, you can use syntax highlighting to make your code blocks pop out on your blog. Jekyll natively supports the [rouge language highlighter](http://rouge.jneen.net/) which has numerous styles to choose between (view them [here](https://spsarolkar.github.io/rouge-theme-preview/)).

In the Markdown for the article, surround code blocks using _backticks_ and specify the language for highlighting:

```{markdown}
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier 
# Create the model with 100 trees
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100,                                                     
                               bootstrap = True,                              
                                max_features = 'sqrt')
# Fit on training data
model.fit(train, train_labels)
```


The default syntax highlighting looks like this:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*OqiP9dlVHfIi6rVH0O6J0w.png)
*Default Python syntax highlighting with Rouge*

Using a custom defined theme, the highlighting comes out like so:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*E_SnqNetmD4-AUll1ozXvQ.png)
*Custom Python syntax highlighting*

To set your own code theme, refer to [this article](https://bnhr.xyz/2017/03/25/add-syntax-highlighting-to-your-jekyll-site-with-rouge.html), or if you like the look of mine, you can copy and paste my code style sheet `code-highlighting.scss` ([link](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/willkoehrsen.github.io/blob/master/_sass/_code-highlighting.scss)) into your `_sass/` directory. Then change the line in `style.scss` that reads `@import “highlights”` to `@import “code-highlighting"` (this should be near the bottom) to import the new style instead.

#### GitHub Gists

Another common part of my Medium posts are GitHub gists. To properly show these in your posts, start by going to the original medium article, right click on the Gist, and select `inspect frame` .

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3WBVfYgyor0jJOBg23HvXg.png)
*Inspecting frame of GitHub gist*

This will bring up a page of what looks like incomprehensible code. However, all you need to do is copy what’s between the `<script>` tags as below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9aghj_p-1_jQGheiMutHDA.png)
*Frame source for gist*

Simply copy and paste this line into the Markdown as shown below and it will be properly rendered on your blog.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*zVdpXVfSBVDn45Zl2W1LkA.png)
*GitHub Gist in Markdown*

Of course, like any other element on your website, you can style the block using css however you like!

#### Post Excerpts

By default, Jekyll will only show the first paragraph of your post on the main page of your blog with a button showing Read More to access the rest. If you have a picture at the top of your post, this is all that will be displayed.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*VZlj8trqLdQsrJpPSlMN2A.png)
*Default excerpt shown on blog home page*

To extend the excerpt, add the following line to `_config.yaml`:

```{yaml}
# Specifies end of excerpt
excerpt_separator: <!--more--></pre>
```

Then put the `<!--more-->` tag in the post markdown wherever you want the excerpt to end.

Post Excerpt in Markdown | How it Looks on Website
:-: | :-:

#### Additional Considerations

There are still numerous options I haven’t explored. If you want to do something on your blog, chances are there’s a way to get it done. For example, you can add comments to all of your posts by making a Disqus account and adding it to your `_config.yaml` file ([guide here](https://disqus.com/admin/install/platforms/jekyll/)). If you have a lot of posts and want to limit the number that appear on one page, you can specify that as well using `pagination` in the config file ([instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/)).

Building a website is exciting because you are able to make it look however you want! Although this might not seem amazing to most people, I still appreciate when I make a minor update to my site and I can see the changes online just as I intended. You can’t imagine how enthusiastic I was when I finally got a live code editor running on my about page! At the end of the day, yes, building a website is about putting yourself out there for the world to see, but it’s also about taking pride in something you created.

### Conclusions

Going from an existing Medium article to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) can be done quickly using a command line tool. There are a few minor errors that need to be addressed after converting to Markdown, but this also gives you the chance to customize the post exactly how you want.

If you are still stuck on any points, take a look through my [website repository](http://github.com/willkoehrsen/willkoehrsen.github.io) to see if you can find a solution there, or get in contact with me. Moreover, if you find something cool that you can do with a [Jekyll](http://jekyllnow.com) blog, I’d enjoy hearing about it. Now get out there and start writing.
