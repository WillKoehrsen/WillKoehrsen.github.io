__Mission statement__: Make the greatest possible positive social impact using data science. I believe in
helping others around you propser, whether through working a socially benefical career, writing
free data science articles to educate others, or volunteering in one's community. We all have choices to make,
and I've decided to devote my career to trying to improve human sustainability, which I think can be done most effectively as a data scientist working in the energy sector.

## Live Code

Most about pages are pretty dull. To mix things up, I've included a live Python editor where you can edit and run code. Thanks to [repl.it](https://repl.it/) for making this possible.
