# How to Put Fully Interactive, Runnable Code in a MediumÂ Post

## Code is meant to be interactive.

1.  Head to [repl.it](http://repl.it)
2.  Write some code in your favorite language.
3.  Copy and paste the url for your repl into a Medium post.
4.  Publish the post to make the code interactive.

<iframe data-width="800" data-height="600" width="980" height="735" src="/media/a78e615dc30472498fcfca242186904e?postId=3dce6bdf4895" data-media-id="a78e615dc30472498fcfca242186904e" data-thumbnail="https://i.embed.ly/1/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Frepl.it%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Freplit-logo-800x600.png&amp;key=a19fcc184b9711e1b4764040d3dc5c07" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe>Interactive code. In a Medium article! (from [repl.it](http://repl.it)).

Feel free to play around with the code above. This is a simple example, but you can create complex scripts for readers to run in many languages.

#### Notes

*   The code is only fully interactive _after_ you publish
*   You can add packages, data files, or include multiple scripts in your repl
*   This does work on mobile although not perfectly
*   Each time the page is reloaded, the packages are installed

Besides embedding code in your articles, repl.it has a great [discussion forum](https://repl.it/talk) and [interactive exercises](https://repl.it/community) to learn coding.
