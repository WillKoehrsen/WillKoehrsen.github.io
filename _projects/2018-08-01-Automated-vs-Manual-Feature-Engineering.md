In this project, I took on three different machine learning problems, solving each one with both manual and automated feature engineering using [Featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools). Each of the three projects represents a complete machine learning problem and shows that automated feature engineering can reduce development time by up to 10x, deliver better modeling performance, build explainable features, and prevent data leakage in time-dependent problems. Moreover, automated feature engineering can be applied across datasets using the exact same framework, leading to reliable and efficient feature engineering.
