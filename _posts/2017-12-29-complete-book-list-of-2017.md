## One year, 50 books, innumerable ideas.

Ranked in order of impact on my worldview.

1.  **_The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined_ by Steven Pinker**

The world has never been more peaceful than it is now thanks to the civilizing force of strong governments, more trade between countries, increased respect for the role of women in society, the communication ability of mass media, and the ever-greater reliance on rational thought and critical thinking.

**_2\. Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind_ by Yuval Harari**

Humans distinguished themselves from all other animals on Earth by our communication abilities and our belief in “collective fictions”, constructs such as money, religion, and laws that only exist because many individuals believe in them together.

**3\. _Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow_ by Yuval Harari**

Having conquered war, plague, and famine in the second half of the 20th century, humanity will spend the 21st century in a quest for superhuman abilities through genetic enhancements and human-machine integration.

**4\. _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow_ by Aurelion Geron**

Machine learning is now accessible to all with open-source, easy-to-use frameworks, and anyone can learn to build practical machine learning implementations with minimal resources.

**5\. _Thinking, Fast and Slow_ by Daniel Kahnemann**

In our daily lives, we often make irrational decisions by employing shortcuts as a result of our automatic, quick system one instead of using our slow, logical system two.

**6\. _Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation_ by Steven Johnson**

Ideas emerge not from deep within a specific field, but at the intersection of different areas of study, which is why the internet and college campuses are such fertile grounds for innovation.

**7\. _The Worst Journey in the World_ by Apsley Cherry-Garrard**

A first-hand account of Robert Scott’s 1912 expedition to be the first person to the South Pole which ended with Scott reaching the pole one month after Roald Amundsen and perishing on the return journey due to a series of mistakes and poor decisions.

**8\. _Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions_ by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths**

We can incorporate computer science solutions to problems such as constraint satisfaction and the explore-exploit into our daily decision-making processes to improve our lives.

**9\. _Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life_ by Adam Greenfield**

A well-thought-out review of the perils and potential benefits of emerging technologies such as 3-D printing and cryptocurrency, and a call for us to think about what we give up — mainly privacy and autonomy — when we uncritically adopt new technologies into our lives.

**10\. _Better: A Surgeon’s Notes on Performance_ by Atul Gawande**

Medicine, as with any other field of human endeavor, is not perfect, but that should not prevent us striving to improve our methods and surpass our previous achievements.

**11\. _Watership Down_ by Richard Adams**

An inspiring tale of survival and kinship focusing on a group of rabbits (yes really) that manages to encompass the entire range of human emotions in a page-turning narrative.

**12\. _The Culture of Fear_ by Barry Glasner**

Despite unequivocal evidence the world is becoming a healthier, safer, richer, and more equitable place, people continue to believe everything is going downhill due to increased news coverage of negative events and no mention of the improvements made every single day.

**13\. _The World Until Yesterday: What Can We Learn from Traditional Societies_ by Jared Diamond**

People in the modern, industrialized world have much to learn about child-rearing, elder care, and wellness from traditional tribes and chiefdoms.

**14\. _Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness_ by Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein**

The findings of behavioral science can be used to improve both our personal lives and our societies if we accept and account for the fact that humans do not behave rationally and may need coaxing in order to make the optimal decisions for their well-being.

**15\. _Deep Learning with Python_ by Francois Chollet**

Deep learning — mainly neural networks — is accessible through frameworks such as Keras in Python that abstract away much of the theory and let anyone with basic programming skills build state-of-the-art models.

**16\. _Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies_ by Nick Bostrom**

A shrill warning about the potential catastrophic effects of general artificial intelligence if it is not developed with the proper motivations and safeguards.

**17\. _The Elephant Vanishes_ by Haruki Murikami**

A collection of short stories in the magical realism genre which describe worlds that are disconcertingly similar to ours but feature unexpected elements just beyond the realm of our physical reality.

**18\. _How the Mind Works_ by Steven Pinker**

A thorough and enjoyable examination of various facets of human psychology such as emotions, vision, feminism, rationality, and consciousness through the lens of evolution.

**19\. _Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy_ by Cathy O’Neil**

Data science is supposed to enable equality through objective decisions, but models are ultimately built by humans with certain views and fed data that reflects the current state of the world, leading to a continuation of inequality because as the saying goes: “bias in, bias out.”

**20\. _How Not to be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking_ by Jordan Ellenberg**

An accessible and entertaining look at how we can overcome many of the fallacies we make in areas such as probability and optimization using mathematical concepts.

**21\. _The Borderlands of Science_ by Michael Shermer**

Science has undoubtedly been the greatest invention of humankind, but it has also been used to justify atrocities and sell worthless “cures” to the unaware public through “scientifical” language.

**24\. _Winter World: The Ingenuity of Animal Survival_ by Bernd Heinrich**

A surprisingly intriguing look at the varied ways animals survive harsh winters, from hibernating bears to the Kinglet bird species which spend the entire day eating food and the entire night shivering to stay alive.

**25\. _Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and Think_ by Viktor Mayer-Schonberger and Kenneth Cukier**

Massive amounts of data will change our society in three ways: we will expect that all data, no matter how minor, should be collected; we will care less about the quality of individual data points because we can look at the aggregate; and we will place greater emphasis on finding correlations and less importance on establishing causation.

**26\. _Once a Runner_ by John L. Parker Jr.**

A story about a collegiate cross country team that inspired me to start running seriously and complete several ultramarathons.

**27\. _Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void_ by Mary Roach**

**28\. _The Second Machine Age: Work Progress and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies_ by Wrik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee**

In the first machine age (the Industrial Revolution) machines were a complement to humans, but in the second, computer-driven machine age, humans cognitive abilities will be surpassed and we need to prepare for an economy in which people have no role.

**29\. _Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt_ by Michael Lewis**

A detailed accounting of the rise of algorithmic trading, in which machines execute billions of trades a second, focused on the major players, both those who make millions, and those trying to reform the industry.

**30\. _How We Decide_ by Jonah Lehrer**

Even though we know what choices we should make, we often choose the incorrect option because of cognitive shortcomings and unconscious decision-making, but we can take steps to make smarter choices.

**31\. _Why People Believe Weird Things_ by Michael Shermer**

Stories of the paranormal, faith healing, or extrasensory perception are seductive even to highly-educated people because they want to think there is more to reality than we can perceive, and these false beliefs should be patiently addressed before they can affect public policy.

**32\. _Letter to a Christian Nation_ by Sam Harris**

Religion, in particular Christianity, is a negative force in America and its influence in all aspects of society puts our country at a severe disadvantage compared to more secular countries where decisions are based on reason.
