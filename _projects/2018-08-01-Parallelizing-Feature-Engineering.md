### Summary 

In this project, I use the parallel computing library Dask in order to parallelize a computation-heavy automated feature engineering task, in the process, reducing the run time from over 25 hours to less than 3. Rather than immediately try to get a bigger machine, this project shows how parallel processing allows us to get the most from our available hardware.
