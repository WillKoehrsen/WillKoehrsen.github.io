## Using the Wayback Machine to Find Lost Pages

404 pages have gotten more creative over the years:

*404 pages from GitHub (left) and HopperMagic (right) [(Source)](https://www.10forward.ae/24-clever-404-error-pages-from-real-websites/)*

However, that does not make them less annoying, especially when searching for critical data. Pages can disappear for many reasons: someone forgot to pay hosting fees, governments deemed the info subversive, individuals try to scrub records from the web, or mundane infrastructure problems. The average life of a webpage [has been variously reported](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2011/11/the-average-lifespan-of-a-webpage/) as 44, 75, and 100 days; whatever the exact number, one thing is clear: [the Internet is leaky](https://qz.com/1623479/how-to-save-your-internet-data-before-it-disappears/) and content is not guaranteed to stay around forever.

Enter the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/): simply install [this chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak?hl=en-US), and unlock those disappeared pages that have been saved in the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/):

You can also go to [http://web.archive.org/](http://web.archive.org/) and search for the url:

*Saved versions of a previously inaccessible website ([here](http://web.archive.org/web/2017*/https://carlsonschool.umn.edu/assets/72401.pdf))*

This shows you all the versions of the webpage saved over time. If you want to see previous versions of a website, paste in the url and time travel.

The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web and other information on the Internet developed and maintained by the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a non-profit with the [modest goal of “archiving the entire Internet](https://blog.archive.org/2016/10/25/20000-hard-drives-on-a-mission/) and providing universal access to all knowledge”. They maintain a library of digital content free for anyone to access. To date it contains:

*   330 billion [web pages](http://archive.org/web/)
*   20 million [books and texts](https://archive.org/details/texts)
*   4.5 million [audio recordings](https://archive.org/details/audio) (including 180,000 [live concerts](https://archive.org/details/etree))
*   4 million [videos](https://archive.org/details/movies) (including 1.6 million [Television News programs](https://archive.org/details/tv))
*   3 million [images](https://archive.org/details/image)
*   200,000 [software programs](https://archive.org/details/software)

All of this information — growing by 15 TB per day (as of 2016) — lives on physical infrastructure at the Internet Archive. Currently, there are [over 20,000 disks of up to 8 TB](https://blog.archive.org/2016/10/25/20000-hard-drives-on-a-mission/) trying to archive the entirety of human knowledge.

This may seem a little overwhelming, but on a practical level, you can use the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine to access missing web pages that have been saved. If you’re worried about a page being taken down (maybe because it’s controversial) you can also [save it through the Chrome Extension or the Internet Archive website.](https://help.archive.org/hc/en-us/articles/360001513491-Save-Pages-in-the-Wayback-Machine) There are other tools that may allow you to see old web pages like [Chrome’s cached page](https://superuser.com/questions/411506/how-to-view-chromes-cached-web-page)s. As with all human infrastructure, the Internet and [digital tools crumble over time](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/), nonetheless, the Internet Archive and Wayback Machine give you one way to fight the decay.
