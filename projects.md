# Automated vs Manual Feature Engineering for Machine Learning

In this project, I took on three different machine learning problems, solving each one with both manual and automated feature engineering using [Featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools). Each of the three projects represents a complete machine learning problem and shows that automated feature engineering can reduce development time by up to 10x, deliver better modeling performance, build explainable features, and prevent data leakage in time-dependent problems. Moreover, automated feature engineering can be applied across datasets using the exact same framework, leading to reliable and efficient feature engineering.

### Summary

In this complete data science for good machine learning project, I build a gradient boosting machine model to predict poverty levels in Costa Rica. I also experiment with several different methods including UMAP for dimensionality reduction, oversampling to deal with imbalanced classes, recursive feature elimination for feature selection, and automated feature engineering using Featuretools. It turns out the same techniques and skills that can be used to get people to click on more ads can also be used to improve outcomes for our fellow humans.

### Summary 

In this project, I use the parallel computing library Dask in order to parallelize a computation-heavy automated feature engineering task, in the process, reducing the run time from over 25 hours to less than 3. Rather than immediately try to get a bigger machine, this project shows how parallel processing allows us to get the most from our available hardware.
